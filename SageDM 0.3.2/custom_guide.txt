Guide for creating custom adventures for SageDM.

Having JSON knowledge will help, but not required.

File structure is as follows:

example_file - home directory
|
| data.json - data file (folder can be called anything, but JSON file MUST be called data.json)


Inside data.json: (comments are included in parentheses, do not include in own code)

{"story" : {
	"title" : "My Map", (whatever you want the name to be.)
	"help" : "This message shows up whenever the player types 'help'",
	"rooms" : {
		"main" : { (main room must be called "main")
			"message" : "This is the main room.\nTo the left is room 1 and to the right is room 2.\n", (the '\n' indicates a new line, a la Python.)
			"items" : null, (items are declared in this field)
			"connected_rooms" : ["room_1", "room_2"],
			"available_dir" : ["left", "right"], (dir must match up to rooms they go to, e.g. "room_1" and "left" are both 0 in the list.)
			"obstacles" : null,
            "NPCs" : "Tom" (NPCs are declared in room as well as NPC field)
		    },
		"room_1" : {
			"message" : "This is room 1.\nTo the right is the main room.\n",
			"items" : ["key"], (if a room has an item, it is declared in an array.)
			"connected_rooms" : ["main"],
			"available_dir" : ["right"],
			"obstacles" : null,
            "NPCs" : null
			},
		"room_2" : {
			"message" : "This is room 2.\nTo the left is the main room.\n",
			"items" : null,
			"connected_rooms" : ["main"],
			"available_dir" : ["left"],
			"obstacles" : "door", (the player cannot enter this room until they have collected the key from room_1)
            "NPCs" : null
			}
	    	},
	"items" : { (all items listed above need to be declared. If there are 2 of the same item, it only needs to be listed once.)
		"key" : {
			"message" : "Opens door." (message prints when 'inv is typed')
		    }
		},
	"obstacles" : { (same as the items, if declared in a room, it needs to be declared here.)
		"door" : { 
			"is_passable" : false,
			"victory_condition" : true, (when the door is opened, the game end message plays)
			"message_stopped" : "The door is locked.",
			"message_passed" : "You unlocked the door",
			"req_item" : "key" (when player has 'key' in inv, door opens)
			},
    
	"NPCs" : {
		"Tom" : {
			"message_default" : "Hello, this is a default message.", (if req_item == null: only this message shows)
			"message_quest" : "This is the quest message, the game will not show this if the req_item is null",
			"message_passed" : "The game will only show this message if the player has req_item in their inv.",
			"req_item" : null, (req_item must also be declared above like key)
			"give_item" : null (give_item is similar, if you complete Tom's quest, he will give you whatever item is in the list)
			}
		}
	}

}

This should get you started. When I update the project, I'll also update the instructions.
While backwards compatibility is important to me, some updates may break old custom adventure packs.

Code w/o comments in 'test' folder. Play this map by typing 'custom' and then 'test' at the prompt.
