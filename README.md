<h1>PyDnd - Version 0.0.3 - Sage DM Test</h1>

Improvements - Minor bug fixes.
Added new data to JSON file.
Still very much a work in progress.

This is my basic class demo for my new single player DND Client. 

Compilation:

Prerequisites - Python3 or later.

Linux/Mac - put dnd folder in directory of your choice, eg. Desktop. 
In terminal, type "cd ~/Desktop/dnd". 
Then, "python3 main.py".

Windows - put dnd folder on desktop.
Open folder, and click the folder icon next to the up arrow. Press Ctrl-C to copy path.
In Windows Start menu, type cmd to open command line.
In command line, type "cd" and then paste path using Ctrl-V. 
Then, type py main.py
