<h1>SageDM Alpha 3.2 (v. 0.3.2) - NPC gameplay</h1>

<h3>HUGE UPDATE:</h3>

Now you can actually play with the NPCs.

Until this update, the NPC would just say 1 of 4 random phrases, but now they can have item quests, and can give the player an item for completing a quest.

This adds depth to the engine, as now you do not need to only find items on the floor, but can get needed items from NPCs. After this, my main focus will be combat, 

which will be stored in the same Python module, and use similar, though not identical, code.

Enjoy!
